# MemoryLink Architecture Summary
*SPARC Architecture Phase - Executive Summary*

## Architecture Overview

MemoryLink is designed as a **local-first personal memory system** that provides a unified memory layer for AI agents and developer tools. The architecture prioritizes privacy, simplicity, and scalability while maintaining a clear separation between local and cloud operations.

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. **Technology Stack**
- **API Layer**: FastAPI + Uvicorn (Python 3.11)
- **Vector Storage**: ChromaDB with embedded SQLite
- **Embeddings**: SentenceTransformers (local CPU inference)
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with PyCryptodome
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Future Scaling**: Kubernetes-ready design

### 2. **Design Principles**
- **Local-First**: All data stored locally by default
- **Privacy by Design**: Application-level encryption at rest
- **Stateless Services**: Horizontal scaling capability
- **Boring Technology**: Proven, stable components
- **Container Native**: Docker-first deployment strategy

### 3. **Core Components**

#### API Server (FastAPI)
- Async HTTP request handling
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation
- Pydantic data validation
- Health check endpoints
- Structured JSON logging

#### Memory Service Layer
- Orchestrates memory operations
- Handles business logic
- Manages component interactions
- Error handling and recovery

#### Vector Storage (ChromaDB)
- Embedded vector database
- SQLite persistence backend
- Metadata indexing and filtering
- Cosine similarity search
- Local file storage

#### Security Layer
- AES-256-GCM content encryption
- Environment-based key management
- Input validation and sanitization
- Audit logging (non-sensitive)
- Future: API key authentication

## Data Flow Architecture

### Add Memory Flow
```
Client → Validation → Embedding (100-500ms) → Encryption (1-5ms) → Storage (10-50ms) → Response
Total: ~150-600ms per operation
```

### Search Memory Flow
```
Query → Embedding → Vector Search → Filtering → Decryption → Ranking → Response  
Total: ~150-650ms per search
```

## Scalability Strategy

### MVP (Single Node)
- ChromaDB embedded storage
- SQLite metadata persistence
- In-process embedding generation
- Docker Compose deployment

### Production Scale
- Stateless API containers
- Distributed ChromaDB clusters
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Persistent volume storage
- Load balancer integration

### Performance Optimizations
- LRU caching for embeddings (500 items, 24h TTL)
- Query result caching (1000 items, 1h TTL)
- Connection pooling
- Async I/O throughout
- Model loading optimization

## Security Architecture

### Local-First Privacy
- Default localhost-only binding
- No external API dependencies
- All processing on user's machine
- Optional cloud sync with end-to-end encryption

### Data Protection
- AES-256-GCM encryption for all content
- Selective metadata encryption
- Secure key derivation (PBKDF2)
- Environment variable key management
- Future: Hardware security module support

### Compliance & Audit
- GDPR compliance through local storage
- Operation audit logs (non-sensitive)
- Data portability support
- User-controlled data lifecycle
